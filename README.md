TAD FA22 Deep Dive

## Notes for potential reflection
* One thing I'm running into is that all webpages are formatted in different ways, both visually (and in the underlying HTML).
    * ex. class names aren't standardized (like not all headers have `header` as their class ID)
* interactivity! how does that even work?
